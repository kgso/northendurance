        Welcome to North Endurance - home of West Street CrossFit! As the
        COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our day to day lives, the health
        and safety of our athletes and community has never been more important
        to us. We are currently operating at a limited capacity as we work to
        keep North Endurance clean and safe! Regrettably we are not able to
        accept new members at this time - but if you are interested in getting
        started with us, or you have any questions, please click here to contact
        us!
