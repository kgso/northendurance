      <p>Hey there, Adam here - aka Coach Red! CrossFit for me started in 2014 at Functionally Fit in Cold Lake, Alberta. What started simply as the gym I could walk to from my apartment, quickly became something I fell in love with!</p>
      <p>Around the time I was working in Alberta I was also fortunate to be able to travel a little bit, and stopping to visit CrossFit gyms was always at the top of the list. When I first earned my CF-L1 it was just out of a passion for the sport, but when I returned to Halifax in 2015 I had an opportunity to start coaching at CrossFit Kinetics.</p>
      <p>In 2020 my wife and I bought CFK, which is now North Endurance! Despite the challenges that 2020 brought, for us it was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made. We’re very excited to be a part of, and to help lead, the growth of our gym for years to come.</p>
      <p>Away from the box - and my number one favourite job - I’m a father of two to Percy and Henry, a husband to my wife, Sam, and I do my best to keep up with our dog, Chandler. I’m a proud StFX graduate, Steelers fan, and I enjoy spending weekends on the patio - if not mine than at a local craft brewery.</p>

      <p>Hey, I’m Coach Charles! It didn’t take long after starting CrossFit in 2015 for me to realize this was what I wanted to do—which is why it also didn’t take me long to travel up to Montréal to earn my Level 1 Coaching Certificate.</p>
      <p>A former football player at Mount Allison University, sports have been part of my life from a young age. A born and raised Haligonian, I’m happy to be able to give back to my community every day through sport.</p>
      <p>Whether it be teaching a new CrossFitter the mechanics of each movement or helping to perfect the technique of a seasoned athlete, watching members reach their goals is the highlight for me.</p>
      <p>Outside the gym, I like paying homage to my Scottish roots watching rugby with a good scotch in hand. And some call me the CrossFit version of Ronald Ulysses Swanson, but I’m not sure why!</p>

      <p>Hi, I’m Nicole! I started doing CrossFit at CFK - now North Endurance - in 2014 after moving to Halifax to attend Dalhousie University. I quickly grew to love the community vibe of CrossFit, and always being challenged with a unique workout each day!</p>
      <p>I love barbell and strength training, and conquering my goals one step at a time to learn new skills.</p>
      <p>In November of 2021 my interest had expanded to coaching, so I took my CF-L1 Certificate Course to further my knowledge of CrossFit, improve my own skills and technique, and others’ too!</p>
      <p>I’m originally from New Glasgow but now call Dartmouth home. Outside of CrossFit I am a full-time Pediatric Emergency Registered Nurse. I enjoy reading, being outdoors, and hanging out with my two cats - Luna and Gideon.</p>

      <p>Hey, I'm Coach Sarah! I started CrossFit in 2016 and knew right away it was the perfect form of fitness for me - constantly varied. What I didn't know at the time is what a huge impact it would have on my life. It's even how I met my husband!</p>
      <p>The community at North Endurance is one of a kind and I'm happy to be able to give back to a community who has given me so much.</p>
      <p>When I'm not at North Endurance, I am a Web Team Lead at REDspace and focus on software development. I find coding is very similar to CrossFit - there are so many different skills that come up, and it's difficult to become proficient in all of them.</p>
      <p>As a coach at North Endurance I want to help our community become more proficient in all areas of CrossFit in order to meet and exceed their goals - and to have lots of fun doing it!</p>
