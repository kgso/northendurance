    bio:
      "<p>Hey there, Adam here - aka Coach Red! CrossFit for me started in 2014 at Functionally Fit in Cold Lake, Alberta. What started simply as the gym I could walk to from my apartment, quickly became something I fell in love with! Around the time I was working in Alberta I was also fortunate to be able to travel a little bit, and stopping to visit CrossFit gyms was always at the top of the list. When I first earned my CF-L1 it was just out of a passion for the sport, but when I returned to Halifax in 2015 I had an opportunity to start coaching at CrossFit Kinetics. In 2020 my wife and I bought CFK, which is now North Endurance! Despite the challenges that 2020 brought, for us it was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made. We’re very excited to be a part of, and to help lead, the growth of our gym for years to come.</p><p>Away from the box - and my number one favourite job - I’m a father of two to Percy and Henry, a husband to my wife, Sam, and I do my best to keep up with our dog, Chandler. I’m a proud StFX graduate, Steelers fan, and I enjoy spending weekends on the patio - if not mine than at a local craft brewery.</p>",

    bio:
      "<p>Hey, I’m Coach Charles! It didn’t take long after starting CrossFit in 2015 for me to realize this was what I wanted to do—which is why it also didn’t take me long to travel up to Montréal to earn my Level 1 Coaching Certificate.</p><p>A former football player at Mount Allison University, sports have been part of my life from a young age. A born and raised Haligonian, I’m happy to be able to give back to my community every day through sport. Whether it be teaching a new CrossFitter the mechanics of each movement or helping to perfect the technique of a seasoned athlete, watching members reach their goals is the highlight for me.</p><p>Outside the gym, I like paying homage to my Scottish routes watching rugby with a good scotch in hand. And some call me the CrossFit version of Ronald Ulysses Swanson, but I’m not sure why!</p>",

    bio:
      "<p>Hey there, I’m Coach Rhea! Born and raised in Halifax, you can often find me dancing along with the music—when I’m coaching and working out myself! I’ve been training in CrossFit since 2017 and started coaching in 2021. This community has been such a huge part of my life over the years that I couldn’t wait to get started with the coaching staff.</p><p>I love introducing new people to the sport through our introductory program and you can usually find me with my favorite furry co-coach, Kevin.</p>",

    bio:
      "<p>Hi, I’m Nicole! I started doing CrossFit at CFK - now North Endurance - in 2014 after moving to Halifax to attend Dalhousie University. I quickly grew to love the community vibe of CrossFit, and always being challenged with a unique workout each day! I love barbell and strength training, and conquering my goals one step at a time to learn new skills.</p><p>In November of 2021 my interest had expanded to coaching, so I took my CF-L1 Certificate Course to further my knowledge of CrossFit, improve my own skills and technique, and others’ too!\nI’m originally from New Glasgow but now call Dartmouth home. Outside of CrossFit I am a full-time Pediatric Emergency Registered Nurse. I enjoy reading, being outdoors, and hanging out with my two cats - Luna and Gideon.</p>",

    bio:
      "<p>Hey, I'm Coach Sarah! I started CrossFit in 2016 and knew right away it was the perfect form of fitness for me - constantly varied. What I didn't know at the time is what a huge impact it would have on my life. It's even how I met my husband! The community at North Endurance is one of a kind and I'm happy to be able to give back to a community who has given me so much.</p><p>When I'm not at North Endurance, I am a Web Team Lead at REDspace and focus on software development. I find coding is very similar to CrossFit - there are so many different skills that come up, and it's difficult to become proficient in all of them. As a coach at North Endurance I want to help our community become more proficient in all areas of CrossFit in order to meet and exceed their goals - and to have lots of fun doing it!</p>",
