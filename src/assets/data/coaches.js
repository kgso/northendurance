    bio:
      "<p>Hey there, Adam here - aka Coach Red! CrossFit for me started in 2014 at Functionally Fit in Cold Lake, Alberta. What started simply as the gym I could walk to from my apartment, quickly became something I fell in love with! Around the time I was working in Alberta I was also fortunate to be able to travel a little bit, and stopping to visit CrossFit gyms was always at the top of the list. When I first earned my CF-L1 it was just out of a passion for the sport, but when I returned to Halifax in 2015 I had an opportunity to start coaching at CrossFit Kinetics. In 2020 my wife and I bought CFK, which is now North Endurance! Despite the challenges that 2020 brought, for us it was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made. We’re very excited to be a part of, and to help lead, the growth of our gym for years to come.</p><p>Away from the box - and my number one favourite job - I’m a father of two to Percy and Henry, a husband to my wife, Sam, and I do my best to keep up with our dog, Chandler. I’m a proud StFX graduate, Steelers fan, and I enjoy spending weekends on the patio - if not mine than at a local craft brewery.</p>",

      "<p>Hey there, I’m Coach Rhea! Born and raised in Halifax, you can often find me dancing along with the music—when I’m coaching and working out myself! I’ve been training in CrossFit since 2017 and started coaching in 2021. This community has been such a huge part of my life over the years that I couldn’t wait to get started with the coaching staff.</p><p>I love introducing new people to the sport through our introductory program and you can usually find me with my favorite furry co-coach, Kevin.</p>",

    bio:
      "<p>Hi, I’m Nicole! I started doing CrossFit at CFK - now North Endurance - in 2014 after moving to Halifax to attend Dalhousie University. I quickly grew to love the community vibe of CrossFit, and always being challenged with a unique workout each day! I love barbell and strength training, and conquering my goals one step at a time to learn new skills.</p><p>In November of 2021 my interest had expanded to coaching, so I took my CF-L1 Certificate Course to further my knowledge of CrossFit, improve my own skills and technique, and others’ too!\nI’m originally from New Glasgow but now call Dartmouth home. Outside of CrossFit I am a full-time Pediatric Emergency Registered Nurse. I enjoy reading, being outdoors, and hanging out with my two cats - Luna and Gideon.</p>",
