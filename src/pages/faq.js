              </p>
              <p className="mt-1 max-w-xl text-base text-gray-500 lg:mt-2">
                CrossFit combines the best parts of weightlifting, sprinting,
                calisthenics, and kettlebells. Plus, we do a little bit of basic
                gymnastics. By sticking to the most effective exercises from
                each, we can do these really efficient workouts in about 30
                minutes. They’re hard, but they have to be. It takes a couple of
                years to be really great at CrossFit, but you can be good in a
                few months.

                THE TRAINING SESSIONS LOOK TOO HARD, IS CROSSFIT JUST FOR ELITE
                ATHLETES?

              <p className="mt-1 max-w-xl text-base text-gray-500 lg:mt-2">
                One of the great things about CrossFit is that the training can
                be “scaled” to suit everyone, regardless of their skill or
                fitness level. Scaling means that the same workout can be
                adjusted for different individuals by keeping the same format
                but substituting different exercises, changing the intensity,
                reducing or increasing the volume (number of reps or rounds), or
                changing the amount of rest.

                We don’t know, everyone is different. members have the option to
                ONLY do Personal Training if they wish, BUT our group classes
                are extremely motivating and there is an indefinable magic that
                emerges when you surround yourself with the positive people in
                our community. The magic comes from the mixture of competition
                and team work, which drive our members to personal performances
                they never dreamed was possible! All of this while guided by a
                knowledgeable coach!

                Yes. Our programs can be modified (scaled) for injuries,

                Absolutely Not. This is the most common misconception about
                CrossFit. Yes, it has a reputation for being hard, but all of
                our workouts will be scaled and modified to accommodate whatever
                level of fitness you’re at now. CrossFit Kinetics is for
                individuals of all sizes, fitness levels and backgrounds. The
                tools for your success is built into our every day programing
                and our Right Start Introduction program. Don’t decide you have
                to get in shape first to come here to get in shape. That’s a
                recipe for never starting. We work with all kinds of people in
                all kinds of shapes, which is an enormous source of pride for
                us.

                Immediately across the road from the gym there's a parking lot
                with 6 spaces for our members. You'll also find that there is
                plenty of road parking along side of the gym. Be sure to pay
                attention to the no parking signs, we are next to the Fire Hall
                and they are quick to tow you if you're parked illegally!
